riddles
=======

From time to time I want to implement some stuff in python:
- a proof of concept
- solution to some simple but interesting problem
- do some programming excercise


And this is a repository for it.


I have some further ideas, but I'm not sure I would be doing next - if you have any funny ideas
which would fit in to this description - contact with me :). Ideas are welcome.
